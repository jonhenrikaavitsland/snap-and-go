# SNAP&GO: JS2

![image](./src/assets/images/screenshot.jpg)

## Description

This project is a group work of three students. This project aims to demonstrate skills in JS as part of a school project. The project features a social media platform where a user can post an image and include up to 150 characters of text. The user can view other posts, react to them, comment, and follow other users as they like. Users can register an account with a @noroff.no or stud.noroff.no email address. Because several students are using the API, we made sure only posts with images that were posted on our platform are displayed in the feed, this is because we wanted to have a stronger focus on images in our project.
